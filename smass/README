## ANN Stellar Mass Estimator

In this repo you find all the notebooks during the research & development (RD) of my the stellar mass estimator. 
The current final product is a code based on artifical neural networks (ANN). 
The precision of the measurements is excellent, $0.06$ dex, validated on SDSS+GALEX+WISE dataset. 
Note the validation set is very different of the training one. 
SDSS+GALEX+WISE redshift sample is a magnitude limited sample, $m_r<17.8, it's very compared to the COSMOS sample (which is the deepest sample with 31 bands).
