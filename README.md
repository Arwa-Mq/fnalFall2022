# Fnal Fall 2022 
________________
In this repo is my progress made during my stay at Fermilab. The topics that I worked on are listed bellow:  <br>

<ul>
<li> `smass`: RD of a machine learning (ML) stellar mass estimator based on the COSMOS (Hubble deep field).
<li> `r200`: improvements of the copacabana $R_{200}$ estimator using stellar masses. 
<li> `qmodel`: quenching model RD.
</ul>
