# Fnal Fall 2022 
________________
In this repo is my progress made during my stay at Fermilab. The projects that I (am) work(ing) on are listed bellow:  <br>

- `smass`: RD of a machine learning (ML) stellar mass estimator based on the COSMOS (Hubble deep field) dataset.
- `r200`: improvements of the copacabana $R_{200}$ estimator using stellar masses. 
- `qmodel`: quenching model RD.

Undergoing project. Things might be a bit messy and not well documented.
